# 2ManyRecipes

## A toy, single-page recipe scraper

### [Live version, here.](https://danrounds.github.io/2ManyRecipes/)

_2ManyRecipes_ submits API queries to YouTube and Yummly and aggregates them 
into recipe- and accompanying-video-results. The YouTube results are non-robust,
because it seems Freebase (their content-tagging database) is deprecated.

This project was an exercise in calling 3rd-party APIs and presenting data in a
dynamic page in a coherent way. Also, an excuse to use Bootstrap and prettify things.

### Tech used:
* jQuery
* Bootstrap 3/FlatUI theme
* YouTube and Yummly's databases/API

### To-do:
* Clean up JS
* Add in-page attribution to Yummly and YouTube

Recipe results, courtesy [Yummly](https://www.yummly.com/); videos courtesy
