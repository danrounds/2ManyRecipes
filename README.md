# 2ManyRecipes

## A toy, single-page recipe scraper

[Live version, here.](https://danrounds.github.io/2ManyRecipes/)

_2ManyRecipes_ submits API queries to YouTube and Yummly and aggregates them into recipe and accompanying video results. The YouTube results are non-robust, because it seems Freebase (their content-topic database) is deprecated.

This project was an exercise in calling 3rd-party APIs and presenting data in a dynamic page, in a coherent way. Also, an excuse to use Bootstrap and prettify things.

### Tech used:
* jQuery
* Bootstrap 3/FlatUI theme
* YouTube and Yummly's databases/API

### To-do:
* Clean up index.html and subfolders&#8212;make sure we're using only files we need
* Clean up JS
* Add in-page attribution to Yummly and YouTube
